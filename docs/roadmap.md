# Roadmap

A lot of things are missing from `Quokka`.

In no particular order :

* export and use types information
* expose operands data in a comprehensive way
* performances improvements of the references
 

 ## TODO List

The list belows contains some task that should be tackled

* [ ] Rewrite the Reference Manager
* [ ] Remove the interface for Function Chunks
* [ ] Use `weakref` for Program
* [ ] Use the CI for tests (since the plugin works with an IDA Free version, it should be possible to write end-to-end tests)
* [ ] Quokka for Ghidra / Binary Ninja (maybe a bit ambitious)
* [ ] Support [Fat binaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_binary)
* [ ] Verify the support for unknown architectures
